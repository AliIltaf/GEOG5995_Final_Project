# GEOG5995 Final Project

This project aims to answer the following research question:

"Is there an assoiciation between the health and deprivation of a LSOA in Greater Manchester?"

The project is aimed at policymakers, who can use the insights provided to plan the distibution of health facilities across different LSOAs across Greater Manchester. The project contains CDRC data from the Access to Healthy Assets & Hazards (AHAH) and Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) datasets. The python notebook contains code to clean and visualise the data from these two datasets and contains justifications for the design choices made.

In order to run the python notebook, first an environment must be created using the YAML file provided in this repository. The the zip files in the repository must be extracted in order to access the datasets. The extracted folders must be placed in the working directory from which the notebook is being run from.
